# Linux File System with C

This project implements a Linux-like file system using C. It provides ⚙️ functionalities for creating, managing, and manipulating 📂 files and 📁 directories. Users can interact with this file system through a 🔧 command-line interface.

## **About the Project**

The project mimics a 🔬 hierarchical file system where 📂 directories and 📁 files are represented as nodes in a 🌲 tree structure. It supports a wide range of operations, including 🌟 file creation, 🗑 deletion, moving 📂 files, handling symbolic links 🔗, directory traversal, and even compressing 🔐 and decompressing the entire file system.

### **Features**

- 🔄 Creation of 📁 files and 📂 directories.
- 🔎 Recursive listing of directory contents.
- ➔ Move, 🔁 rename, and 🗑 delete files and directories.
- 📝 Save and load the directory structure.
- 🔗 Symbolic link creation.
- 📃 Directory sorting by name or date 🕒.
- 🔐 Merge directories with conflict resolution.
- 🏎️ Compression and decompression of the directory structure.

## **How to Use**

### **Compilation**

Ensure you have the required development tools and libraries installed (e.g., `gcc` and `zlib`). Then compile the project:

```bash
gcc -o linux_file_system main.c -lz
```

### **Running the Program**

Run the compiled executable:

```bash
./linux_file_system
```

You will enter a ⚖️ command-line interface where you can execute various commands to interact with the 🏢 file system.
